    <h2> Mexico </h2>
  <p>
    February 10, 2017 to February 14, 2017

We stayed in the south portion of the Condesa region at an Airbnb titled "Gorgeous Apt, Perfect for 6" at 288 Av. Tamaulipas, which was actually a really great Airbnb location. If, I were to do it again though, and I will I think I would do an Airbnb that is a tad more north but at least the taco stand right outside of our Airbnb was downright amazing! Don’t know the name of the taco stand and don't care. The majority are great just find the one that has the most folks at it and act like a local.

Travel to and from the airport was pretty easy especially with Uber. I'm guessing the average wait on an Uber the entire trip was 0.237 seconds. Uber is everywhere and the fare is more than fair.  We used Uber to get everywhere, it made our travel way too easy. We even used Uber to get to and from the airport as well as all the way out to Teotihuacan.

As far as food, there was tremendous opportunity and value in all directions. Everything from amazing cash only taco shops to 5 star world rated restaurants (Pujol). All that is needed is a little online research and you can't go wrong for your bigger meals but you can always stubmle upon some great find but due to the quantity of selection and likely limited travel time, a little research can go a long way. We definitely see ourselves vising a few of the same eateries next time we are in Mexico City. We ate some great pastor tacos at the place that claims they are the "creadores" of the Pastor taco, just a few blocks north of our Airbnb. We had some amazing tasty food compilations and creations at Pujol along with mezcal pairings and a "happy ending". Don’t ask, don't tell.

We visited multiple museums, exhibits, and ruins and the big revelation I had was just how diverse the Mexican history is and how proud they are of it. We went to the Anthropology museum, the National History museum at the Chapultepec castle, the Soumaya museum and the Teotihuacan ruins. The castle was a great walkthrough event but do not underestimate the climb to the top. We decided to conquer this climb our fist afternoon in the city and let's just say we were not quite acclimated to the altitude and lost our breath quickly and easily. The castle offers a different perspective on history compared to what is taught in American schools. I personally found that very intriguing, it was a pleasant reminder that history always have two sides of the story, in particular the events between Mexico and Texas and Mexico and the United States. Although, not going to lie, the history literature was challenging my rusty Spanish skills. The views of the city from the castle truly showed the grandeur of this extremely large city and the intricacies of the castle are not to be passed over. The Anthropology museum offered what felt like unlimited information. The exhibits for the Aztecs, the Mayan, and the Oaxacan cultures were very interesting but if you are really into museums, then you should block off an entire day and invest in a guide otherwise make your rounds and get out the there. The information and exhibits are incredibly vast and even more challenging to a novice Spanish practitioner. The volume of exhibits can and will exhaust you.

The Suomaya gallery really offered a lengthy display of artwork from all over the world grouped in various phases, styles cultures, etc. all original in a beautiful vertical spiral gallery free of entry charge. This truly is an amazing gift from a generous donor. The displays of complex ivory artwork is mind-blowing and I particularly liked the varying artwork from Venice was really enlightening.

Teotihuacan is called the Pyramid of the Sun for a reason, wear sunscreen! These ruins are about an hour away from downtown but getting an Uber is the way to go, do not do a tour group. The size of the Aztec (or non-Aztec) complex is truly astounding. We were able to climb the world's third largest pyramid rather quickly but it did make us slow down a bit due to the steepness. I was impressed with the gravitas of the structure as well as the overall symmetry. There were so many minor pyramids (structures) along the avenue of the dead and all of them were so evenly constructed, it was a very impressive adventure.

Other parting thoughts about Mexico City:
	- The city vastness and complexities along with some very lower income and dungy areas as well as the upper income and ritzy areas might lead to uneasiness. It all matters where you are. Location, location, location. Do a little research and all will be fine.
	- The National Ballet is a little different than American ballet. If you have time go check it out, but don't pay extra to sit in a box.
	- If you time your trip right and the exchange rate is greatly in your favor, live a little. You won't regret it, just don't check the scale any time soon until you get back in the gym.
	- Spanish speaking is a requirement and it sure was fun for me to break off the rust and really dive back into it.
	- Mezcal is to tequila as Moonshine is to whiskey
	- There is a crazy vibrant night life so go check it out and bring folks with you that want to go enjoy it. We hit up a Pulqueria and it was really a unique experience and pulque is the natural Four Loco.
	- Oh, and don't get punked out on a shoe shine.

Until next time, Viva Mexico!
